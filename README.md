# React Formula Capstone

This was the capstone project from React Formula. I used this course to build my React skills and get more hands-on knowledge of the language. 
React was something I struggled to self-teach until I found this course. By the end of it, I was completing entire modules my way without the help of walkthroughs or hints. 
This course included the use of several modules as well. Please enjoy using this mock web store.

## Tools used

## What I learned
I was able to reinforce my understanding of Hooks and components. My code was clean and I was able to create components wisely.
